title: "Hi There!"

My name is Yuan Bian (Chinese: 边缘; Pronunciation: Yoo-an Bee-an). I am a senior Psychology major in University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am originally from Hangzhou, China.

My research interests are majorly in computational psycholinguistics (cognitive models!). I am currently working with two groups: at UIUC, I work in Gary Dell's Langauge Production Lab on adult phonotactics learning of 2nd order constraints with suprasegmental contexts; at Stanford, I work with Abdellah Fourtassi and Michael Frank on predicting age of acquisition using word connectivity.

I am fascinated with philosophy of mind and metaphysics. I often read Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.
